# Flashcard Versus Game - Server

A live production example is available at:

http://w4kw4c8.49.13.84.100.sslip.io/

> The above is deployed using the docker files included in both client and server repositories.

## Run the server application

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run start
```

The above will start the application server, and will run on port 3000

Additionally the client code should also be run to access the server.
